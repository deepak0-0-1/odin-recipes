    <p><em>Pizza is a popular Italian dish consisting of a usually round, flatbread base topped with various ingredients
            such as tomato sauce, cheese, vegetables, meats, and herbs. It is typically baked in an oven until the crust
            is crispy and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</em></p>
    <p><em>Originating from Italy, pizza has become a beloved dish worldwide, with countless variations and styles. From
            the classic Margherita with fresh basil and mozzarella to more adventurous toppings like barbecue chicken or
            pineapple, pizza offers endless possibilities for customization. It is often enjoyed as a casual meal with
            friends and family, making it a versatile and universally loved food.</em></p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups warm water (110째F or 45째C)</li>
        <li>3 1/2 to 4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Your choice of toppings (pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, olives, etc.)</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves (optional)</li>
        <li>Grated Parmesan cheese (optional)</li>
        <li>Olive oil for brushing</li>
        <li>Flour for dusting</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Activate the Yeast: In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water. Let it sit for about 5-10
            minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
        <li>Make the Dough: In a large mixing bowl, combine 3 1/2 cups of flour and salt. Make a well in the center and
            add the yeast mixture and olive oil. Mix until a dough forms. If the dough is too sticky, gradually add more
            flour until it is smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Knead the Dough: Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead for about 8-10 minutes until it is soft and
            elastic. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place
            for about 1-1.5 hours or until it has doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to 475째F (245째C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to
            heat up as well.</li>
        <li>Shape the Dough: Punch down the risen dough and turn it onto a floured surface. Divide it into two equal
            portions for two pizzas. Roll out each portion into a round shape, about 12 inches in diameter. Transfer the
            rolled-out dough to a pizza peel or baking sheet dusted with flour or cornmeal.</li>
        <li>Add Toppings: Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the pizza dough, leaving a small border around the
            edges. Sprinkle with shredded mozzarella cheese and add your desired toppings.</li>
        <li>Bake the Pizza: If using a pizza stone, carefully slide the pizza onto the preheated stone in the oven. If
            using a baking sheet, simply place it in the oven. Bake for about 12-15 minutes or until the crust is golden
            brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Finish and Serve: Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Brush the crust with
            olive oil for extra flavor. Garnish with fresh basil leaves and grated Parmesan cheese if desired. Slice and
            serve hot.</li>
