    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500g boneless chicken (cut into bite-sized pieces)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 cup tomato puree</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 onion (finely chopped)</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic (minced)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ginger (grated)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chili powder (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin powder</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh cilantro leaves (for garnish)</li>
        <li>Cooked basmati rice or naan bread (for serving)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Marinate the Chicken: In a bowl, combine the chicken pieces with half of the garam masala, turmeric powder,
            chili powder, and salt. Mix well and let it marinate for at least 30 minutes (or overnight in the
            refrigerator
            for better flavor).</li>
        <li>Cook the Chicken: In a large skillet or pan, heat 1 tablespoon of butter over medium heat. Add the marinated
            chicken pieces and cook until they are browned and cooked through. Remove the chicken from the pan and set
            it
            aside.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Sauce: In the same pan, add the remaining butter. Saut√© the chopped onions until they become
            translucent. Add the minced garlic and grated ginger, cooking for another minute until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add Spices: Stir in the remaining garam masala, cumin powder, and a pinch of salt. Cook for a minute to
            toast
            the spices.</li>
        <li>Add Tomato Puree: Pour in the tomato puree and cook for about 10-15 minutes, allowing it to thicken and the
            flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li>Add Cream: Reduce the heat to low and stir in the heavy cream. Simmer for a few minutes until the sauce is
            creamy and well combined.</li>
        <li>Combine Chicken and Sauce: Return the cooked chicken pieces to the pan, stirring them into the sauce. Let it
            simmer for another 5-10 minutes to allow the chicken to absorb the flavors of the sauce.</li>
        <li>Garnish and Serve: Garnish with fresh cilantro leaves. Serve hot with cooked basmati rice or naan bread.
        </li>
    </ol>
