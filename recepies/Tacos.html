    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>8 small corn or flour tortillas</li>
        <li>500g ground beef, chicken, or pork (or a plant-based alternative)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded lettuce</li>
        <li>1 cup diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded cheese (cheddar, Monterey Jack, or a Mexican blend)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>Salsa, guacamole, and sour cream for serving</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Filling: Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook
            until it becomes translucent, about 3-4 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until
            fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the Meat: Add the ground beef, chicken, or pork to the skillet. Cook, breaking it up with a spoon, until
            it is browned and cooked through, about 6-8 minutes. If using a plant-based alternative, cook according to
            package instructions.</li>
        <li>Season the Meat: Stir in the chili powder, cumin powder, paprika, salt, and pepper. Cook for another 2-3
            minutes to allow the flavors to meld together. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>Warm the Tortillas: Heat a dry skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. Warm each tortilla for about 30
            seconds on each side until they are pliable and slightly charred. You can also wrap them in a damp paper
            towel and microwave for about 20-30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Assemble the Tacos: Place a warm tortilla on a plate. Spoon a generous amount of the meat filling onto the
            center of the tortilla. Top with shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, shredded cheese, and chopped cilantro.
        </li>
        <li>Add Toppings: Add salsa, guacamole, and sour cream as desired.</li>
        <li>Serve: Fold the tortilla in half to enclose the filling. Serve immediately while warm. Enjoy your delicious
            tacos!</li>
