        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic (minced)</li>
        <li>1 cup bean sprouts</li>
        <li>2 green onions (sliced)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup crushed peanuts</li>
        <li>1 lime (cut into wedges)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tamarind paste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon chili flakes (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Noodles: Soak the rice noodles in warm water for about 20-30 minutes until they are soft. Drain
            and set aside.</li>
        <li>Make the Sauce: In a small bowl, mix together the fish sauce, soy sauce, tamarind paste, sugar, and chili
            flakes (if using). Set aside.</li>
        <li>Cook the Protein: Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large pan or wok over medium-high heat. Add the
            shrimp or tofu and cook until they are cooked through. Remove from the pan and set aside.</li>
        <li>Cook the Eggs: In the same pan, add a little more oil if needed. Crack the eggs into the pan and scramble
            them until they are just cooked. Push them to one side of the pan.</li>
        <li>Stir-Fry: Add the minced garlic to the pan and saut√© for about 30 seconds until fragrant. Add the drained
            rice noodles and pour the sauce over them. Toss everything together to coat the noodles evenly with the
            sauce.</li>
        <li>Add Vegetables: Add the cooked shrimp or tofu back into the pan along with the bean sprouts and sliced green
            onions. Stir-fry for another 2-3 minutes until everything is well combined and heated through.</li>
        <li>Serve: Transfer the Pad Thai to serving plates. Garnish with crushed peanuts and lime wedges on the side.
            Serve immediately.</li>
