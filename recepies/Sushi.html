    <p><em>Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish that typically consists of vinegared rice combined with various
            ingredients such as raw or cooked seafood, vegetables, and sometimes tropical fruits. It is often served
            with soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger.</em></p>
    <p><em>Originating in Japan, sushi has become a popular cuisine worldwide, known for its delicate flavors and
            artistic presentation. There are several types of sushi, including nigiri (hand-pressed rice topped with
            fish), maki (rolled sushi wrapped in seaweed), and sashimi (sliced raw fish without rice). Sushi is often
            enjoyed as a communal meal, allowing diners to share and savor a variety of flavors and textures.</em></p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 cups sushi rice</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups water</li>
        <li>1/3 cup rice vinegar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>Nori sheets (seaweed)</li>
        <li>Fresh fish (like tuna, salmon) or cooked seafood (like shrimp, crab)</li>
        <li>Vegetables (like cucumber, avocado, carrots)</li>
        <li>Soy sauce (for dipping)</li>
        <li>Wasabi (optional)</li>
        <li>Pickled ginger (optional)</li>
        <li>Bamboo sushi rolling mat (optional but helpful)</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the Rice: Place the sushi rice in a fine-mesh strainer and rinse under cold water until the water runs
            clear. This removes excess starch and prevents the rice from becoming too sticky.</li>
        <li>Cook the Rice: In a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed rice and water. Bring to a boil over medium-high
            heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes or until the water is
            absorbed and the rice is tender. Remove from heat and let it sit, covered, for an additional 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Prepare the Sushi Vinegar: In a small bowl, mix together the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt until the sugar
            dissolves. You can gently heat it in the microwave or on the stove if needed.</li>
        <li>Season the Rice: Transfer the cooked rice to a large bowl. While it is still warm, pour the sushi vinegar
            mixture over the rice. Use a wooden spatula or spoon to gently fold the vinegar into the rice, being careful
            not to mash the grains. Allow the rice to cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Prepare Fillings: While the rice is cooling, prepare your sushi fillings by slicing fish and vegetables into
            thin strips or bite-sized pieces.</li>
        <li>Assemble Sushi Rolls (Maki): Place a sheet of nori on a bamboo sushi rolling mat (if using). Wet your hands
            with water to prevent sticking, then spread a thin layer of sushi rice evenly over the nori, leaving about 1
            inch at the top edge free of rice. Arrange your desired fillings in a line across the center of the rice.
            Using the bamboo mat, carefully roll the sushi away from you, applying gentle pressure to form a tight roll.
            Seal the edge with a little water.</li>
        <li>Slice and Serve: Use a sharp knife to slice the sushi roll into bite-sized pieces. Repeat with remaining
            ingredients. Serve with soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger on the side.</li>
